A small library to check the buttons connected to Analog PIN (A0) of the MCU.
Was tested on a Wemos D1 R1 mini board. 
The ADC values for each button should be set and checked depending on the resistir's resistance, 
which is connected to the button. 
Example sketch is included with the wiring explanations.
